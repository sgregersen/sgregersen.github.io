My master’s thesis (University of Copenhagen, 2014) was a study of the form and function of _fordi_ ‘because’ clauses in modern spoken Danish, more specifially the word order of such clauses and their semantic relation to their matrix clause. The corpus consisted of recorded speeches from the Danish Parliament. This represents a register not usually included in investigations of spoken language, which tend to focus on more informal and colloquial speech styles.

The results suggested that _fordi_ ‘because’ clauses in modern Danish differ in a number of ways from how they have traditionally been described, even in a formal register like parliamentary speeches. For instance, they more frequently have verb-second (V2) than verb-third (V3) word order, a feature often described as colloquial, and they were found to introduce interrogative clauses, suggesting that _fordi_ is not always a subordinating conjunction.

[A revised version](https://doi.org/10.7146/nys.v1i57.117119) of my master’s thesis was published in 2019 in _NyS_ [Journal of Modern Danish]. I have later returned to the topic of causal clauses in my work on [Wangerooge Frisian](/projects/wf/).
