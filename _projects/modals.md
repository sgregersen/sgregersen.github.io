In my PhD dissertation (University of Amsterdam, 2020), I investigated a number of semantic and grammatical changes in the history of the English modal verbs, in particular in the Middle English period (1100–1500 CE). A number of these changes have received only little attention in the literature, but are relevant for our understanding of both the history of English and the semantic pathways of modal markers.

In addition to corpus data from Old, Middle and Early Modern Danish, I used material from other Germanic languages to look for similarities and differences between these modal systems. With my colleague Wim Caers I investigated the peculiar ‘independent’ modals which appear to be a shared feature of Dutch, Low German, and West and East Frisian.
