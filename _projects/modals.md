In my PhD dissertation (University of Amsterdam, 2020), supervised by [Olga Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Fischer), I investigated a number of semantic and grammatical changes in the history of the English modal verbs, most of them in the Middle English period (1100–1500 CE). Some of these changes have received only little attention in the literature, but are highly relevant for our understanding of the history of English as well as the diachronic pathways of modal expressions. 

In addition to corpus data from Old, Middle and Early Modern English, I used material from other Germanic languages to look for similarities and differences between historically related modal systems. Some of the main findings of my PhD work were:

- The (apparent) morphological regularisation of some Middle English modals, most importantly _shall_, was most likely due to analogical influence from the ‘anomalous’ verb _will_. The innovative forms show an areal distribution, being more prevalent in the dialect area where _shall_ and _will_ had the same stem vowel. This investigation appeared as an [article](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1360674322000053) in _English Language & Linguistics_.

- There is no evidence of either grammaticalisation or degrammaticalisation of _dare_ from Old English to the present day. Rather, _dare_ has been characterised by functional stability and a number of formal changes which were all analogical in nature. The syntactic and semantic characteristics of _dare_ were explored in [this article](https://doi.org/10.1515/stap-2017-0012), while a proposal about the transitive use of _dare_ (as in _I dare you!_) was made in a [short paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/notesj/gjx152) in the philological journal _Notes & Queries_.

- The epistemic use of _may_ did not develop out of the permission sense (i.e. deontic modality), as has been repeatedly claimed in the literature. Rather, the source of the epistemic meaning was ‘wide-scope’ possibility contexts. Close parallels to this development have been observed in Dutch and German, possibly pointing to an areal tendency in Western Europe (cf. also [this chapter](https://wals.info/chapter/76) in the _World Atlas of Language Structures_).

- The change of _must_ from a possibility to a necessity modal happened in so-called participant-imposed dynamic contexts, where an open possibility was reinterpreted as the only possible course of action. This Early Middle English development was found to have an apparent parallel in Late Middle Danish, where the modal _mughe_ also changed from possibility to necessity (Modern Danish _måtte_), as shown in [this paper](/assets/pdf/SOF_mughe.pdf). A less technical overview of the history of _måtte_ appeared in the Danish journal _[Mål & Mæle](/assets/pdf/M&M_maa.pdf)_.

In addition, with my colleague [Wim Caers](https://researchportal.be/en/researcher/wim-caers) (University of Antwerp), I carried out a small investigation of what we termed [“independent” modals](https://doi.org/10.5117/nedtaa2019.3.005.caer) (e.g. West Frisian _dat kin_ ‘that is possible’). We showed that this construction is found across several dialects of Dutch, Low German, and Frisian, i.e. the “coastal” West Germanic languages, and suggested that its distribution is likely due to historical contact between these languages. 

During my time as a PhD candidate I also published a number of book reviews and review articles on topics relating to the [history of English](https://doi.org/10.18148/hs/2020.v4i2.68), [modality](https://doi.org/10.1080/03740463.2020.1743582), and [historical linguistics](https://doi.org/10.1515/flih-2018-0012) more generally.
