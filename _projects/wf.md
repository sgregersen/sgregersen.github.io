Wangerooge Frisian is a now extinct Frisian language once spoken on [Wangerooge](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/53.7910/7.8990), a small island in the German Wadden Sea. This language was extensively documented before it went extinct in the first half of the 20th century, but has so far received little attention in the linguistic literature. My current project is a grammatical description of the Wangerooge Frisian language as it was preserved in documentation mainly from the 19th century. The project is supported by the [Carlsberg Foundation](https://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/en) and hosted by the [Department of Frisian Studies](https://www.isfas.uni-kiel.de/de/frisistik) at Kiel University.

The language of Wangerooge was a remnant of the medieval [Old Frisian](https://medieval.ox.ac.uk/2022/11/03/lecture-old-frisian-a-gem-of-old-germanic-studies-by-dr-anne-popkema/) language, which had gradually lost ground to Low German since the Middle Ages. A [chronicle](https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/en/details/bsb11054802) from 1671 mentions that the inhabitants of Wangerooge had their own language ‘which an outsider cannot understand at all’ (“eine besondere [Sprach] / die ein fremder / gar nicht verstehen kan”). The first linguistic documentation of this language consists of a word list and some grammatical notes from around 1800.

The main reason that we can study Wangerooge Frisian today is the work of [H. G. Ehrentraut](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Georg_Ehrentraut) (1798–1866) and his consultants. Ehrentraut was a lawyer and politician who developed a strong interest in Frisian language and history. In the period 1837–1841 he carried out fieldwork on Wangerooge and wrote down texts in Wangerooge Frisian in his own phonetic alphabet. The material includes fairy tales, descriptions of daily life on the island, and extensive lists of words and grammatical forms. Some of this was published in Ehrentraut’s own journal _[Friesisches Archiv](https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/en/view/bsb10018278?page=5)_ (1849–1855), but most of it lay hidden in an archive until it was published by Versloot ([1996](https://www.worldcat.org/title/907241310)).

The middle of the 19th century also marked the beginning of the end of Wangerooge Frisian. After a [tidal flood](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neujahrsflut_von_1855) destroyed much of the village on Wangerooge in 1855, the inhabitants were resettled on the mainland. Within only a few generations most people had stopped speaking Wangerooge Frisian and switched to Low German instead. When the German linguist [Theodor Siebs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Siebs) (1862–1941) visited the community in the 1920s, only seven elderly speakers remained.

In my project, I describe the grammatical structure of Wangerooge Frisian using the material collected by Ehrentraut, Siebs, and other people who took an interest in the language. A short project description can also be found on the website of the [Carlsberg Foundation](https://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/da/Forskningsaktiviteter/Bevillingsstatistik/Bevillingsoversigt/CF21_0502_Sune-Gregersen). A preliminary syntactic sketch of Wangerooge Frisian is available [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7775493). This is still very much work in progress, so feel free to send me an [email](mailto:s.gregersen@isfas.uni-kiel.de) if you have any comments or suggestions.
