Habituals are aspectual markers expressing that a situation usually occurs, such as English _used to_, Spanish _soler_, or the suffix _-va_ in Czech and Slovak. Despite an abundant literature on aspect in various languages of the world, habituals are a somewhat neglected phenomenon in linguistic research.

I am currently investigating the cross-linguistic diversity of habitual markers in collaboration with a number of colleagues from the University of Amsterdam. Together with [Eva van Lier](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/l/i/e.h.vanlier/e.h.vanlier.html), I am working on a study of habitual markers in a sample of c. 150 of the world’s languages. We are particularly interested in the formal properties of such markers, i.e. how habitual meaning is expressed, and their lexical sources, i.e. where they come from. Our research at the moment focusses on habitual serial verbs, a type of construction which appears to be especially frequent in and around New Guinea.

In the research group _[Habituals](https://aclc.uva.nl/content/research-groups/habituals/habituals.html)_, led by [Kees Hengeveld](http://www.keeshengeveld.nl/), we explore the diversity of habitual constructions from the perspective of [Functional Discourse Grammar](http://www.functionaldiscoursegrammar.org/) and the idea of layered semantic structure. The preliminary results of the group suggest that ‘habituality’ is not a unified phenomenon across languages and that many languages have several habitual constructions with subtle semantic differences between them. The group is currently working on a collaborative volume presenting these results along with individual case studies of Spanish, Ancient Greek, Cree, Coptic, and several other languages.
