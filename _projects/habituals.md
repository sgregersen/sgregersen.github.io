Habituals are markers expressing that a situation usually occurs, such as English _used to_, Spanish _soler_, and ???. I am currently investigating the cross-linguistic diversity of such markers in collaboration with a number of colleagues from the University of Amsterdam.

With my colleague Eva van Lier, I am working on a cross-linguistic study of habitual markers in a sample of c. 150 of the world's languages. We are particularly interested in the formal properties of such markers, i.e. how habitual meaning is expressed, and their lexical sources, i.e. where they come from.  

In the research group [Habituals](https://aclc.uva.nl/content/research-groups/habituals/habituals.html), led by [Kees Hengeveld](http://www.keeshengeveld.nl/), we explore the diversity of habitual constructions from the perspective of [Functional Discourse Grammar](http://www.functionaldiscoursegrammar.org/) and the idea of layered semantic structure.
