I am a descriptive and comparative linguist working as a postdoc at [Kiel University](https://www.uni-kiel.de/). My research currently focusses on [Wangerooge Frisian](/projects/wf), a now extinct minority language of Northern Germany. My goal is to publish a grammar of the language based on a substantial text corpus collected in the 19th and early 20th century.

Among other things, I have also worked on the history of [modality in English](/projects/phd), grammatical change in [19th-century Danish](/projects/19th), and [habitual constructions](/projects/hab) (like English *used to*) in the languages of the world. On this website you can read about my research and find most of my papers and presentations for download. If you cannot find what you are looking for – or if you have any questions or comments – you are always welcome to send me an [email](mailto:s.gregersen@isfas.uni-kiel.de).
