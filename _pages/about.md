I am a descriptive and comparative linguist working as a postdoc at the [Department of Frisian Studies](https://www.isfas.uni-kiel.de/de/frisistik), [Kiel University](https://www.uni-kiel.de/). My research currently focusses on [Wangerooge Frisian](/projects/wf), a now extinct minority language of Northern Germany. My goal is to publish a grammar of the language based on a substantial text corpus collected in the 19th and early 20th century.

Before coming to Germany, I studied linguistics at the University of Copenhagen and wrote a PhD on the development of the [English modal verbs](/projects/modals) at the University of Amsterdam. Among other things, I have also worked on grammatical change in [19th-century Danish](/projects/19c_danish) and [habitual constructions](/projects/habituals) (like English *used to*) in the languages of the world.

On this website you can read about my research and find most of my [papers](/publications) and [presentations](/talks) for download. If you cannot find what you are looking for – or if you have any questions or comments – you are always welcome to send me an [email](mailto:s.gregersen@isfas.uni-kiel.de).
