I am a descriptive and comparative linguist working as a postdoc at the [Department of Linguistics and Philology](https://www.uu.se/en/department/linguistics-and-philology), Uppsala University. My research currently focusses on [Baham](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/baha1258), a Papuan language spoken in eastern Indonesia.

Among other things, I have also worked on the grammar of [Wangerooge Frisian](/projects/wf), an extinct minority language of northern Germany, and on [habitual constructions](/projects/habituals) (like English *used to*) in the languages of the world. My dissertation (University of Amsterdam, 2020) focussed on the historical development of the English [modal verbs](/projects/modals).

On this website you can read about my research and find most of my [papers](/publications) and [presentations](/talks) for download. If you cannot find what you are looking for – or if you have any questions or comments – you are always welcome to send me an [email](mailto:sngrs@proton.me).
