<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a descriptive and comparative linguist working as a postdoc at Kiel University. My current project focusses on Wangerooge Frisian, a now extinct minority language of Northern Germany. The goal is to publish a grammar of the language based on documentation collected in the mid-19th century. Among other things, I have also worked on the history of modality in English, grammatical change in 19th-century Danish, and the typology of habitual constructions.</p> <p>On this website you can read about my research and find most of my papers and presentation slides for download. If you can’t find what you’re looking for or if you have any questions or comments, you are always welcome to send me an email.</p> </body></html>
