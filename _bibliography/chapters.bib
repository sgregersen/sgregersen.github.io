  abstract={This paper traces the history of the Danish “marginal” modal gide ‘feel like’ from the Middle Ages to the present day. While gide has developed syntactically in the direction of the modal verbs, its semantic development has rather been away from prototypical modality: in Middle Danish gide expressed possibility (‘be able to’), whereas in Present-Day Danish it expresses an inclination of the subject referent (‘feel like, bother to’). I suggest that this semantic shift happened in contexts where a possibility was contingent on the current disposition of the subject referent, such as their stamina or appetite. I also argue (pace van der Auwera et al. 2009) that Middle Danish gide was not limited to so-called participant-internal possibility contexts.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the meaning of the modal verb mughe in four Late Middle Danish texts from the early 16th century. It is argued that the necessity meaning of mughe, which is still found in Modern Danish måtte, developed in ambiguous contexts where both possibility and necessity were possible readings. In addition, it is suggested that Late Middle Danish mughe is also attested with the meaning ``prediction'', which may have played a role in the development of the necessity meaning.},
