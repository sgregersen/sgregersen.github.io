  booktitle={A layered approach to habitual constructions},
  editor={Gregersen, Sune and Hengeveld, Kees},
  series={Typological Studies in Language},
  number={136},
  abstract={In this book, habitual meaning is studied from a typological perspective, with Chapters 2--11 describing habitual meaning in ten different languages, and Chapter 12 presenting typological generalizations. In this introductory chapter we define the notion of habitual meaning, introduce the theoretical framework used, explain the methodology that was applied, and present our typological predictions. As an appendix we provide the typological questionnaire which the language-specific chapters are based on.},

  series={Typological Studies in Language},
  number={136},
  abstract={This chapter presents typological generalizations that can be derived from a comparison of the data presented in Chapters 2--11 in this volume. The languages are compared in the light of the two predictions presented in Chapter 1: (i) across and within languages, dedicated habitual expressions may differ from one another in terms of the layer(s) at which they apply; (ii) if a habitual expression applies at more than one layer, the layers involved will be contiguous in the hierarchy of layers established within Functional Discourse Grammar. Both predictions are confirmed without exceptions, and thus support the new approach to habitual meanings elaborated in this volume.},

  number={59},
  pdf={DSN_gide.pdf},
  abstract={This paper traces the history of the Danish “marginal” modal gide ‘feel like’ from the Middle Ages to the present day. While gide has developed syntactically in the direction of the modal verbs, its semantic development has rather been away from prototypical modality: in Middle Danish gide expressed possibility (‘be able to’), whereas in Present-Day Danish it expresses an inclination of the subject referent (‘feel like, bother to’). I suggest that this semantic shift happened in contexts where a possibility was contingent on the current disposition of the subject referent, such as their stamina or appetite. I also argue (pace van der Auwera et al. 2009) that Middle Danish gide was not limited to so-called participant-internal possibility contexts.},

  preview={sof.png},
  abstract={This paper investigates the meaning of the modal verb mughe in four Late Middle Danish texts from the early 16th century. It is argued that the necessity meaning of mughe, which is still found in Modern Danish måtte, developed in ambiguous contexts where both possibility and necessity were possible readings. In addition, it is suggested that Late Middle Danish mughe is also attested with the meaning ``prediction'', which may have played a role in the development of the necessity meaning.},
