  abstract={This paper investigates the meaning of the modal verb mughe in four Late Middle Danish texts from the early 16th century. It is argued that the necessity meaning of mughe, which is still found in Modern Danish måtte, developed in ambiguous contexts where both possibility and necessity were possible readings. In addition, it is suggested that Late Middle Danish mughe is also attested with the meaning ``prediction'', which may have played a role in the development of the necessity meaning.},
