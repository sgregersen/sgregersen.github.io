  abstract={This article investigates a case of lexical restrictions on a voice construction, specifically Danish past-tense passives. Present-Day Danish has both a periphrastic and an inflectional passive construction, but in the past tense, most ablaut (strong) verbs cannot form the inflectional passive (e.g. *skreves ‘was written’, *bares ‘was carried’). Various explanations for these restrictions have been proposed in the literature, but their historical background has not been investigated in any detail. This article focusses on the passive restrictions in Late Modern Danish, using various sources mainly from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is shown that while lexical restrictions on the past-tense s-passive are already mentioned in eighteenth and nineteenthcentury grammars, the grammaticality of the individual forms has changed; for instance, the now obsolete form skreves ‘was written’ is attested in several Late Modern Danish sources. Furthermore, the primary sources differ greatly with respect to their use of the passive in the past tense. I suggest that sociolinguistic variables, such as level of education and formality of the texts, must be taken into account when trying to explain the development of the Danish passive, and that the lexical restrictions on past-tense s-passives may in fact be a side effect of standardization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.},

  abstract={The article investigates an overlooked development in the history of the English modals, namely the regularization of their plural inflection in Middle English (e.g. PRS.IND.PL shulleþ for expected shullen). Using the LAEME and eLALME atlases and a number of electronic corpora, I document the frequency and dialectal distribution of such regularized modal verbs. It is shown that regularized SHALL was fairly common in Late Middle English, regularized CAN less so, and regularized MAY only very sporadically attested. The distribution of these forms shows a clear areal pattern, being most numerous in manuscripts from the southwest Midlands. I suggest that the most likely explanation for the observed patterns is interparadigmatic analogy with the ‘anomalous’ verb WILL, which in some dialects had developed the same stem vowel as plural SHALL.},

  volume={14},
  numer={1},
  pdf={LiA_habituals.pdf},
  abstract={This paper investigates the expression of habitual meaning in the three Germanic languages Danish, Dutch, and German. We first survey habitual expressions in Danish, arguing that the primary means for expressing habitual meaning is the catenative verb pleje ‘usually do, used to’. Using a parallel corpus of Danish literary texts from two time periods (1843–1901 and 1973–1987) and their translations into Dutch and German, we then investigate how pleje is translated into these two languages. Although closely related verbs are available in Dutch (plegen) and German (pflegen), our findings suggest that there is no single way of conveying habituality in these two languages. Instead, habituality can be expressed by a number of different strategies which are subject to diachronic and stylistic variation. In addition, the material shows that Danish pleje may have a contrastive function along with its habitual meaning, expressing an explicit contrast between the usual and the current state of affairs.},

The aim of this paper is to discuss this attribution, by resuming Hjelmslev’s biography and academic career (§2) in order to show the plausibility of such hypothesis (§3). We then present (§4) a transcription of the textual occurrences (signs and glosses) found therein, the most relevant of which will be briefly analysed on a conceptual point of view in our final commentary (§5).},

The book investigates the development of mood and modality in four moribund Finnic languages spoken in the Russian Federation: Votic, Ingrian, Central Lude, and Eastern Seto. After a detailed summary of the book, I discuss a number of issues relating to (a) the semantic map used to analyze the modal meanings; (b) the difference between language death-related changes and “regular” language change; and (c) the explanation of the observed patterns in terms of conceptual complexity. On the last point, I suggest that usage frequency may provide a better explanation for some of the observed changes.},

In addition, it is discussed to what extent the choice between V2 and V3 is predicted by the meaning of the fordi ‘because’ clause.},

  preview={lia-logo.png},
  abstract={The paper investigates the meanings of the modal verb MA/MÅ in late Middle Danish, specifically the language at the time of the Reformation in the early 16th century. The goal is to identify the patterns of polysemy between different modal meanings (dynamic, permission, optative, etc.) and to identify the contexts where the change from dynamic possibility (‘can, may’) to dynamic necessity (‘must, have to’) happened. It is argued that this change occurred in contexts where open possibility was reinterpreted as inevitability, possibly through an intermediate stage of ‘prediction’. The development of MA/MÅ is compared to the history of English must and its West Germanic cognates.},

The construction is shown to be widely attested not only in traditional dialects of Dutch, but also in Frisian, Low German, and Afrikaans. We suggest that the construction, which does not occur in standard German or English, is an areal feature shared by the West Germanic vernaculars of northwestern Germany and the Low Countries, including the South African ‘side branch’ Afrikaans.},

It is argued that a more convincing case for the diachronic construction grammar approach could have been made by more explicitly comparing it to other approaches to historical linguistics, and that a number of central notions, such as “constructionalization”, are not applied consistently throughout the volume. In addition, an analysis of the constructionalization of English BE going to presented in the volume is examined and shown not to be supported by the Early Modern English data.},

I then attempt to characterise the novel using the typology of metafictional forms and attitudes proposed by Gemzøe (2001), and point out a number of potential problems with this typology.},

  abstract={The development of dare in the history of English has played an important role in the literature on grammatical change and (de)grammaticalization. This paper aims to clarify two issues regarding the syntax and semantics of dare in earlier English: when it is first attested with to-infinitives, and to what extent it can be said to have been semantically ‘bleached’ in a number of Old English attestations. The conclusions are, firstly, that dare is not attested with to-infinitives in Old English (pace Tomaszewska 2014), and that a number of Middle English attestations that have been suggested in the literature are not convincing (pace Visser 1963–73; Beths 1999; Molencki 2005). Secondly, it is argued that the co-occurrence of dare and verbs like gedyrstlæcan ‘venture, be bold, presume’ in Old English is not an indication of semantic ‘bleaching’ of dare, and that the verb was not more ‘auxiliarized’ in Old English than it is today.},

  abstract={In the standard register of the Danish language, negations and adverbs that are part of the infinitive phrase are placed before the infinitive particle, as in German and Dutch, whereas in standard Swedish, such elements are placed between the infinitive particle and the infinitive form of the verb: hence Danish ikke at være ‘not to be’ vs. Swedish att inte vara, ‘to not be’. However, in modern Danish a ‘split infinitive’ in which an adverb or a negation is placed between at and the infinitive is sometimes encountered in written as well as spoken genres, and this phenomenon is also attested in earlier stages of the written language and in many of the so-called traditional dialects. In this article, the distribution of the Danish split infinitive is investigated, and the possible consequences for the analysis of infinitive clauses in Danish are discussed. It is argued that the field analysis of the syntax of Danish should allow for a degree of flexibility with regard to the position of the infinitive particle.},
