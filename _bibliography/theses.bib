  abstract={This book concerns the early history of the English modals, in particular their morphosyntactic and semantic development in the Old English (c. AD 800–1100) and Middle English (c. AD 1100–1500) periods. The English modals have played an important role in both synchronic and diachronic linguistic work in the last decades, but a number of contested issues concerning their development remain unresolved. This dissertation attempts to answer some of the open questions through careful analysis of the extant Old and Middle English sources and comparison with other Germanic languages, such as Old Norse, Middle Danish, and Middle Dutch. The first part of the book provides a theoretical and methodological introduction to the study of the early English modals, the semantics of modality, and the historical corpora and other textual sources used for the investigation. The second part presents the investigation itself, which consists of four interconnected studies on the development of the modals, focussing on various morphological and syntactic developments in Middle English, the numerous changes to the ‘marginal’ modal DARE, and the semantic development of the ‘core’ modals CAN, MAY, and MUST. I pay particular attention to a number of changes which do not follow the predictions made in the grammaticalization literature, but which can be readily explained with reference to analogy.},

  title={Fire former for kausalitet: En empirisk undersøgelse af fordi-sætninger i dansk talesprog [Four types of causality: An empirical study of fordi-clauses in spoken Danish]},

  abstract={This thesis is an empirical study of causal clauses headed by the conjunction fordi ‘because’ in spoken Danish. Such clauses may have either of two word order patterns, here termed verb-second (V2) and verb-third (V3), and they may serve a number of different semantic functions. The study examines the frequency of these word order patterns in fordi clauses in Danish and the possibility of a correspondence between the word order of the fordi clause and its semantic relation to the matrix clause. The data are five transcripts of debates in the national parliament of Denmark. After a brief introduction to the subject matter, I move on to discuss a number of theories about causal clauses, in particular the ones put forward by Sweetser (1990) and Hengeveld (1996), and conclude that it is possible to distinguish between four different semantic types: physical, intentional, epistemic, and illocutionary causal clauses. I then discuss four studies of Danish causal clauses, which differ as to what is regarded the deciding factor of the two word order patterns. In the following section, I describe my method and discuss some problems regarding the unambiguous identification of the semantic types in a pilot study consisting of one transcript from the parliament. I then go through my main study. The main findings of the study are: The V2 pattern is more frequent in fordi-clauses than the V3 pattern. Fordi clauses occur much more frequently with non-presupposed matrix clauses than with presupposed ones. There is no one-to-one correspondence between the word order of the fordi clause on the one hand and the semantic type of the fordi clause on the other; the same applies to whether the matrix clause contains presupposed information or not. The conjunction fordi can introduce interrogative clauses. I then argue that fordi is a highly polyfunctional conjunction as it may occur with either V2 or V3, with either presupposed and non-presupposed matrix clauses, with all four of the semantic types, and with a following interrogative clause. The last point I take as an indication that fordi is not always a subordinating conjunction, but can be a coordinator as well. Finally, I discuss the relation between causality and relevance and argue that this may serve as an explanation for some of the problems connected to the identification of the semantic type of the causal clauses.},
