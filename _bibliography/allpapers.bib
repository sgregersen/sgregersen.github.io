I argue that the expression is a structural loan from Low German into Danish and North Frisian and that such idiomatic expressions have a great potential for the study of historical language contact.},

  abstract={This paper traces the history of the Danish “marginal” modal gide ‘feel like’ from the Middle Ages to the present day. While gide has developed syntactically in the direction of the modal verbs, its semantic development has rather been away from prototypical modality: in Middle Danish gide expressed possibility (‘be able to’), whereas in Present-Day Danish it expresses an inclination of the subject referent (‘feel like, bother to’). I suggest that this semantic shift happened in contexts where a possibility was contingent on the current disposition of the subject referent, such as their stamina or appetite. I also argue (pace van der Auwera et al. 2009) that Middle Danish gide was not limited to so-called participant-internal possibility contexts.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the use of definite articles in Wangerooge Frisian (Germanic, northern Germany) and discusses a number of methodological problems in the analysis of definiteness in an extinct linguistic variety. I show that Wangerooge Frisian exhibited a ‘split’ definiteness system with two formally and functionally distinct definite articles: the ‘weak’ article de/’t and the ‘strong’ article dan/djuu/dait/daa. Similar systems have been described for other languages of the world, including other Germanic varieties. However, the analysis of the Wangerooge Frisian system is complicated by a number of factors relating to the nature of the linguistic documentation, most of which was collected from an elderly speaker in the mid-19th century. The paper discusses five such issues, such as the lack of metadata about the elicitation situation and the inconsistent stress marking in much of the documentation. I then present a brief sketch of the definiteness system which takes these limitations into account.}

Specifically, the use of the present, past, and perfect constructions is investigated in a corpus of texts from the nineteenth century. It is argued that the Wangerooge Frisian perfect could be used as a non-firsthand evidential strategy marking the propositional content as hearsay or inferred. While such evidential perfects are cross-linguistically well attested, they are generally thought to be uncommon in Western European languages. The Wangerooge Frisian case thus shows the value of lesser-studied vernaculars for the typology of European languages.}

  abstract={The topic of this paper is word order in complement clauses in Wangerooge Frisian, a now extinct language of Northern Germany. Like many other Germanic languages, Wangerooge Frisian had an alternation between verb-second (V2) and verb-late word order in subordinate clauses. The paper investigates the use of V2 and verb-late in complement clauses with dat ‘that’ in the Ehrentraut corpus from the middle of the 19th century. Inspired by the analysis of Danish in Hansen & Heltoft (2011), it is suggested that V2 in Wangerooge Frisian was limited to complement clauses with “constative potential”, while verb-late could occur in all complement clauses.}

  volume={9},
  selected={true},
  year={2023},
  preview={opling.jpeg},
  abstract={This article investigates a case of lexical restrictions on a voice construction, specifically Danish past-tense passives. Present-Day Danish has both a periphrastic and an inflectional passive construction, but in the past tense, most ablaut (strong) verbs cannot form the inflectional passive (e.g. *skreves ‘was written’, *bares ‘was carried’). Various explanations for these restrictions have been proposed in the literature, but their historical background has not been investigated in any detail. This article focusses on the passive restrictions in Late Modern Danish, using various sources mainly from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is shown that while lexical restrictions on the past-tense s-passive are already mentioned in eighteenth and nineteenthcentury grammars, the grammaticality of the individual forms has changed; for instance, the now obsolete form skreves ‘was written’ is attested in several Late Modern Danish sources. Furthermore, the primary sources differ greatly with respect to their use of the passive in the past tense. I suggest that sociolinguistic variables, such as level of education and formality of the texts, must be taken into account when trying to explain the development of the Danish passive, and that the lexical restrictions on past-tense s-passives may in fact be a side effect of standardization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.},

Using the LAEME and eLALME atlases and a number of electronic corpora, I document the frequency and dialectal distribution of such regularized modal verbs. It is shown that regularized SHALL was fairly common in Late Middle English, regularized CAN less so, and regularized MAY only very sporadically attested. The distribution of these forms shows a clear areal pattern, being most numerous in manuscripts from the southwest Midlands. I suggest that the most likely explanation for the observed patterns is interparadigmatic analogy with the ‘anomalous’ verb WILL, which in some dialects had developed the same stem vowel as plural SHALL.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the expression of habitual meaning in the three Germanic languages Danish, Dutch, and German. We first survey habitual expressions in Danish, arguing that the primary means for expressing habitual meaning is the catenative verb pleje ‘usually do, used to’. Using a parallel corpus of Danish literary texts from two time periods (1843–1901 and 1973–1987) and their translations into Dutch and German, we then investigate how pleje is translated into these two languages. Although closely related verbs are available in Dutch (plegen) and German (pflegen), our findings suggest that there is no single way of conveying habituality in these two languages. Instead, habituality can be expressed by a number of different strategies which are subject to diachronic and stylistic variation. In addition, the material shows that Danish pleje may have a contrastive function along with its habitual meaning, expressing an explicit contrast between the usual and the current state of affairs.},

  abstract={This book concerns the early history of the English modals, in particular their morphosyntactic and semantic development in the Old English (c. AD 800–1100) and Middle English (c. AD 1100–1500) periods. The English modals have played an important role in both synchronic and diachronic linguistic work in the last decades, but a number of contested issues concerning their development remain unresolved. This dissertation attempts to answer some of the open questions through careful analysis of the extant Old and Middle English sources and comparison with other Germanic languages, such as Old Norse, Middle Danish, and Middle Dutch. The first part of the book provides a theoretical and methodological introduction to the study of the early English modals, the semantics of modality, and the historical corpora and other textual sources used for the investigation. The second part presents the investigation itself, which consists of four interconnected studies on the development of the modals, focussing on various morphological and syntactic developments in Middle English, the numerous changes to the ‘marginal’ modal DARE, and the semantic development of the ‘core’ modals CAN, MAY, and MUST. I pay particular attention to a number of changes which do not follow the predictions made in the grammaticalization literature, but which can be readily explained with reference to analogy.},

  abstract={The paper critically reviews a recent volume on Diachronic Construction Grammar. It is argued that a more convincing case for the diachronic construction grammar approach could have been made by more explicitly comparing it to other approaches to historical linguistics, and that a number of central notions, such as “constructionalization”, are not applied consistently throughout the volume. In addition, an analysis of the constructionalization of English BE going to presented in the volume is examined and shown not to be supported by the Early Modern English data.},

  abstract={The paper presents an analysis and discussion of the Danish writer Inger Christensen’s experimental novel Azorno from 1967. It is argued that the novel, which is partly in epistolary form, can be read as a literary objet trouvé, a found manuscript consisting of a struggling writer’s unfinished notes and documents. I then attempt to characterise the novel using the typology of metafictional forms and attitudes proposed by Gemzøe (2001), and point out a number of potential problems with this typology.},

  abstract={The development of dare in the history of English has played an important role in the literature on grammatical change and (de)grammaticalization. This paper aims to clarify two issues regarding the syntax and semantics of dare in earlier English: when it is first attested with to-infinitives, and to what extent it can be said to have been semantically ‘bleached’ in a number of Old English attestations. The conclusions are, firstly, that dare is not attested with to-infinitives in Old English (pace Tomaszewska 2014), and that a number of Middle English attestations that have been suggested in the literature are not convincing (pace Visser 1963–73; Beths 1999; Molencki 2005). Secondly, it is argued that the co-occurrence of dare and verbs like gedyrstlæcan ‘venture, be bold, presume’ in Old English is not an indication of semantic ‘bleaching’ of dare, and that the verb was not more ‘auxiliarized’ in Old English than it is today.},

  abstract={In the standard register of the Danish language, negations and adverbs that are part of the infinitive phrase are placed before the infinitive particle, as in German and Dutch, whereas in standard Swedish, such elements are placed between the infinitive particle and the infinitive form of the verb: hence Danish ikke at være ‘not to be’ vs. Swedish att inte vara, ‘to not be’. However, in modern Danish a ‘split infinitive’ in which an adverb or a negation is placed between at and the infinitive is sometimes encountered in written as well as spoken genres, and this phenomenon is also attested in earlier stages of the written language and in many of the so-called traditional dialects. In this article, the distribution of the Danish split infinitive is investigated, and the possible consequences for the analysis of infinitive clauses in Danish are discussed. It is argued that the field analysis of the syntax of Danish should allow for a degree of flexibility with regard to the position of the infinitive particle.},

  abstract={This thesis is an empirical study of causal clauses headed by the conjunction fordi ‘because’ in spoken Danish. Such clauses may have either of two word order patterns, here termed verb-second (V2) and verb-third (V3), and they may serve a number of different semantic functions. The study examines the frequency of these word order patterns in fordi clauses in Danish and the possibility of a correspondence between the word order of the fordi clause and its semantic relation to the matrix clause. The data are five transcripts of debates in the national parliament of Denmark. After a brief introduction to the subject matter, I move on to discuss a number of theories about causal clauses, in particular the ones put forward by Sweetser (1990) and Hengeveld (1996), and conclude that it is possible to distinguish between four different semantic types: physical, intentional, epistemic, and illocutionary causal clauses. I then discuss four studies of Danish causal clauses, which differ as to what is regarded the deciding factor of the two word order patterns. In the following section, I describe my method and discuss some problems regarding the unambiguous identification of the semantic types in a pilot study consisting of one transcript from the parliament. I then go through my main study. The main findings of the study are: The V2 pattern is more frequent in fordi-clauses than the V3 pattern. Fordi clauses occur much more frequently with non-presupposed matrix clauses than with presupposed ones. There is no one-to-one correspondence between the word order of the fordi clause on the one hand and the semantic type of the fordi clause on the other; the same applies to whether the matrix clause contains presupposed information or not. The conjunction fordi can introduce interrogative clauses. I then argue that fordi is a highly polyfunctional conjunction as it may occur with either V2 or V3, with either presupposed and non-presupposed matrix clauses, with all four of the semantic types, and with a following interrogative clause. The last point I take as an indication that fordi is not always a subordinating conjunction, but can be a coordinator as well. Finally, I discuss the relation between causality and relevance and argue that this may serve as an explanation for some of the problems connected to the identification of the semantic type of the causal clauses.},
