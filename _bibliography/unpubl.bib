  title={Habituals in four {Bantu} languages},
  note={Unpublished term paper},

  abstract={The paper surveys the expression of habitual meaning and the origins of habitual markers in four Bantu languages: Eton (A.71), Swahili (G.42), Fwe (K.402), and Nyanja/Chewa (N.31). The division of labour between the habitual marker and other tense and aspect markers differs between the languages, but the coexpression of habitual and generic meaning is found in three of them. Swahili and Fwe both testify to a development COP + INF > HAB, but otherwise the habitual markers under scrutiny have different origins. The final section of the paper considers my findings in light of the cross-linguistic literature on habituals.},
